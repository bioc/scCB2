Description: 
    scCB2 is an R package implementing CB2 for distinguishing real cells from empty droplets in droplet-based single cell RNA-seq experiments (especially for 10x Chromium). 
    It is based on clustering similar barcodes and calculating Monte-Carlo p-value for each cluster to test against background distribution. 
    This cluster-level test outperforms single-barcode-level tests in dealing with low count barcodes and homogeneous sequencing library, while keeping FDR well controlled.
